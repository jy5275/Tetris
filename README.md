A robot good at plaing Tetris.

The main idea is straightforward: Create a virtual board to simulate the dropping of randomly-generated blocks at all position x direction, choose the one with highest evaluation score.

The evaluation algorithm is from CSDN...to implement it is not a hard task.

Score once up to 1k+ and show no sign of endness...
